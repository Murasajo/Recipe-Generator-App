Do you have access to fresh hatch green chiles? If so, you could definitely roast those and use them instead of canned. If not, perhaps roasting a mix of poblano chiles and a few spicy green chiles + adding a little lime juice might help create something similar? Hope that helps! Ashley Joycesays January 8, 2025 at 2:40 pm This was fantastic! My only swap was I cooked a pound of great northern beans and used those since the store didn\\\\u2019t have dried cannellini beans.

It did need some more liquid when I was done and I mixed a little tamari, nooch and hot sauce in a cup of water and added that so it didn\\\\u2019t water down the flavor. I also sprinkled with chili powder and apple cider vinegar at the end. I might add some tofurkey chicken next time too. But it is great as is!

We\\'re grateful for your support! Winter fruits aresurvivors, making it through the coldest days of the year. We had to show them some appreciation. Enter this simple, vibrant winter fruit salad! It almost feelstoosimple to be a recipe (1 bowl,5 ingredients,15 minutes!), but we areMinimalistBaker after all. Let\\\\u2019s make it! This winter fruit salad is indeed EASY! The most complicated part issegmenting an orange. And we promise it onlysoundsintimidating. After you do it once, you\\\\u2019ll be ready to show off your segmenting skills to friends! Or\\\\u2026you can just use a seedless orange! The mainpurpose of segmentingthe orange is toremove the seeds. It does also remove the pith and membranes, ensuring the best texture and maximum sweetness. HOW to segment an orange, you ask? The first step is tocut off the peel. It\\\\u2019s easiest to do this after cutting off the top and bottom of the orange so it sits flat (see photo below). Then you can cut off the sides with ease. Next, you\\\\u2019ll hold the orange in one hand andgently cut inside each membrane(see photo below) to create slices. You\\\\u2019ve now segmented an orange. GO YOU! Next, it\\\\u2019s on to peeling and slicingkiwiand chopping up anapple! Removing the kiwi peel ensures the best flavor and no fuzzy texture. We then like to cut all the fruit intoeven bite-sized piecesbecause somehow it makes the salad taste better. The logic is unexplainable. Buttrust! All that\\\\u2019s left: a drizzle ofhoney, a squeeze oflimeor lemon, and toss it all together! Pomegranate and mintare optional additions for freshness and a pop of color! We\\\\u2019re excited for you to try this fruit salad! It\\\\u2019s:FreshCrunchyVibrantBeautifulLightly sweetenedVeryeasy to make& Perfect for winter!

We\\'re grateful for your support! If you love chocolate covered caramels, but not the complicated methods usually required to make them, then this recipe is for you! These EASY vegan sea salt caramels come together with just6 ingredientsand there\\\\u2019sNO candy thermometerin sight. The secret? Tahini! It adds a decadent flavor to these bite-sized delights for the ultimate salty-sweet treat. Perfect for keeping in the freezer or gifting over the holidays\\\\u2026though we\\\\u2019re not sure how many of these tasty treats will make it to the gift box \\\\ud83d\\\\ude09. Let\\\\u2019s make caramels! These vegan caramels begin somewhat like a classic caramel \\\\u2014 with a butter-sugar mixture \\\\u2014 but this version is made withjust atouchof vegan butterand isnaturally sweetenedthanks to maple syrup. It\\\\u2019s subtly flavored with vanilla extract and has salt because sea salt + caramel = LOVE! The mixture is heated to a boil and cooks for a couple minutes to create arich and caramelizedresult. Then we addtahini, which not only gives these caramels a unique and decadent flavor but packs in some mineral-rich goodness, too! PSA: If tahini in sweets sounds odd, then you haven\\\\u2019t tried thesemagicaltahini blondies.  Next, we pour the mixture into a parchment-lined pan and set in thefreezerto chill. Once in the freezer, the mixture will begin to harden. You\\\\u2019ll know you\\\\u2019ve reached caramel territory when it\\\\u2019s holding its structure and is sliceable. The texture of these caramels isnota hard candy but instead is soft andtender. It\\\\u2019s a bit like fudge, but even morebuttery and decadent! The final step: chocolate! Though these caramels don\\\\u2019t need it (they\\\\u2019re incredible on their own),drizzling or dunking in chocolatetakes them over the top. And a sprinkle of sea salt and sesame seeds? Highly recommend! We can\\\\u2019t wait for you to try these vegan caramels! They\\\\u2019re:Salty-sweetDecadentChocolate-coatedEasy to makePerfect for sharing& SO delicious!

I\\\\u2019ve made it twice now. The second time I made the chocolate layer first, chilled the chocolate layer then pour the caramel layer on top it, worked better for me because the caramel layer stayed intact. I will make it again but use 3/4 cup chocolate. The vegan chocolate I use is very strong and it overpowers the caramel layer. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays January 6, 2025 at 4:42 pm YAY!

Support @ Minimalist Bakersays January 6, 2025 at 9:40 am Oh no! We\\\\u2019re so sorry you didn\\\\u2019t enjoy the caramels, Rachel. These are salted, but it definitely shouldn\\\\u2019t be in an unpleasant way. Is it possible you were using a salted tahini? Alysonsays January 1, 2025 at 5:40 pm Would it work if I substitute honey for the maple syrup? Support @ Minimalist Bakersays January 1, 2025 at 7:07 pm Hey Alyson! That should work, they might come out more chewy! Vanessasays December 22, 2024 at 6:51 pm I made these this weekend and they were so easy and so delicious! I started with 1/2c melted chocolate chips to just dip half of each piece and still had some leftover, so you can work with less chocolate if needed. The maple and vanilla are sweet enough that you could go as dark as you like with the chocolate and it\\\\u2019s still so rich and tasty! I\\\\u2019m vegan but my friends (omnivores) loved them too! I think they could also be great paired with a vanilla ice cream of choice. Thank you again for another great recipe!

I am totally lacking on the presentation skills and my attempt at drizzling chocolate over them was laughable but flavourful combo was the bomb.

Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 16, 2024 at 1:12 pm Oh no! We\\\\u2019re so sorry it\\\\u2019s giving you trouble, Becky. It sounds like it\\\\u2019s maybe seizing up? That can happen if the temperature difference is extreme. Is it possible you store your tahini in the refrigerator? If it\\\\u2019s seizing up, something that can fix that is to return it to the stovetop and slowly add a very small amount of boiling water, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes back together. Keep us posted! Jollysays December 13, 2024 at 9:51 pm These are delicious! Very easy and super quick prep time. I\\\\u2019m not vegan, so I used regular unsalted butter. At two hours in the freezer, mine were set up enough to cut. The texture reminded me more of fudge than caramel, but perhaps that was due to the tahini brand I used, which was Trader Joe\\\\u2019s. It may be grainier than others. Nevertheless, they are REALLY GOOD. I will make them again, I have to try them with the chocolate! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 16, 2024 at 10:37 am We\\\\u2019re so glad you enjoyed them, Jolly! Thanks so much for the lovely review. xo Fransays December 13, 2024 at 1:57 pm The recipe seemed so easy that I made my mind then and there to make it this last working day of the week, and indeed it took me a few minutes to prepare the caramel and freeze it, and finish an hour later dipping the caramels in the chocolate. When the sweet-tooth strikes, you want something quick to make, even better if it can stay in the freezer for future cravings!! I\\\\u2019m not into salted caramel, but the salty flavour is mild enough I suppose because it\\\\u2019s covered in chocolate! I love that the consistency is like mou, which I hadn\\\\u2019t had in ages since I\\\\u2019m milk intolerant. Thank you!

Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 11, 2024 at 8:22 am Hi Rae, we used salted, but it shouldn\\\\u2019t make a huge difference since it\\\\u2019s a pretty small amount! Suzannesays December 10, 2024 at 9:14 pm Will coconut oil work in place of the butter?These sound so good!!!Thanks so much! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 11, 2024 at 8:20 am Hi Suzanne, we haven\\\\u2019t tested this one with coconut oil and don\\\\u2019t think it would taste as buttery, but it might work! The Vegan Goddesssays December 10, 2024 at 6:50 pm OMG, I just drooled a little.  That seems to be a hazard on this site. The only \\\\u201cissue\\\\u201d is that I haven\\\\u2019t found a vegan butter that is devoid of chemicals in it. Is that an essential ingredient that my usual swap of solid coconut oil could not replace? Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 10, 2024 at 7:51 pm Hi! Thank you for your sweet words :) Are you comfortable using Miyoko\\\\u2019s? That\\\\u2019s our preferred brand for having better ingredients! You could try coconut oil in this one, but it probably won\\\\u2019t be quite as buttery in flavor. Another idea would be to bump up the tahini slightly instead! Let us know if you try it out! The Vegan Goddesssays December 11, 2024 at 9:32 am I just looked up the ingredients and question the following items: sunflower oilsunflower lecithincultured cashew milk (cultured?) Cultured probably means they added something like vinegar to it. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 11, 2024 at 11:22 am Everyone\\\\u2019s comfortability will be different! FWIW, sunflower lecithin is used as a supplement for various health benefits and cultured cashew milk could also just mean fermented (like yogurt or kefir is). Maddiesays December 12, 2024 at 3:52 am This looks so good I want to make it before I do the next grocery shop! I\\\\u2019m out of maple syrup. Do you think honey would work? \\\\ud83d\\\\ude42 Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 12, 2024 at 3:50 pm Hi Maddie, honey might work, but we really love the flavor of maple syrup and tahini together! dreasays December 10, 2024 at 2:31 pm This is absolutely delicious!!!!!!  Easy to make and so tasty!  Thank you!! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays December 10, 2024 at 2:39 pm Yay! You\\\\u2019re fast! We\\\\u2019re so glad you enjoy the recipe, Drea.

       "'as I try to avoid consuming too much sugar. I only used 1 Tbsp. pure organic maple syrup, instead of the recommended 1/2 c. coconut sugar, & they were plenty sweet enough due to the medium ripe bananas, so 1 Tbsp. maple syrup worked out perfectly! :) Also I used tapioca starch instead of potato starch, and the texture was absolutely perfect, using flax eggs & added 1/4 c almond flour. Didn\\\\u2019t use walnuts due to allergies. This recipe calls for 10-12 muffins, mine was only 7 muffins, and baking time of 25-30 minutes was enough, anything more than that they would\\\\u2019ve been too dark. I added this recipe to my favorites, & will definitely be making it again. Delicious recipe like always! Thank you, & looking forward to many more!
