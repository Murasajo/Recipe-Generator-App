       "'Minimalist Baker Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links which provide us a small commission when used for purchase. We\\'re grateful for your support! Grilling season is here, and today we’re bringing you an EASY, flavorful addition to your grilling rotation: kofta kebabs! These Middle Eastern-inspired kebabs feature ground chicken, herbs, spices, and aromatics arranged on skewers and grilled to perfection. They’re elegant yet simple and are especially delicious served withlemon rice,hummus,tahini sauce,tabbouleh,grilled veggies, and/or pita. Just1 bowl,10 ingredients, and25 minutesrequired! Let’s make kofta kebabs! Kofta, also spelledkefta,kafta, orkofterefers to meatball- or meatloaf-style dishes made from ground meat mixed with spices and other ingredients. They can be shaped into balls, patties, or cylinders. There are many variations of the dish, and it’s enjoyed in regions ranging from the Middle East to North Africa, South Asia, and beyond. The first recipes for kofta are believed to have come from early Arab cookbooks and were made with lamb. The following is our inspired version made with chicken, and it requires just a few simple spices that achieve a taste similar to what we’ve enjoyed at Middle Eastern restaurants. We begin this dish by mixing together the ground chicken, herbs, spices, onion, garlic, and breadcrumbs. To keep the recipesimple and approachable, we stuck with just a few basic spices: cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and salt. Black pepper and cayenne are optional and add a little kick! After combining the mixture until the spices are evenly distributed, we form it into cylinders and slide them ontometal skewers. Bamboo skewers also work, but they are prone to burning, so it’s best to soak the bamboo in water if going that route. Once all the kebabs have been formed and skewered, it’s grilling time! For grilling, you can use an outdoor BBQ or acast iron grill panon the stovetop. While grilling produces the best flavor, if you don’t have one, you can also form the mixture into patties and cook in an oiled skillet. We hope you LOVE these kofta kebabs! They’re:Elegant yet simpleSubtly spicySatisfyingQuick & easyMiddle Eastern-inspired& SO versatile! The serving options are endless! We especially enjoy these kebabs withlemon rice,hummus,tahini sauce,tabbouleh,grilled veggies, and/or pita. They would also be delicious withharissa chickpeas, couscous, dolmas,falafel, and other Middle Eastern dishes. If you try this recipe, let us know!

Δ Sophiesays September 7, 2024 at 12:12 pm This recipe is perfect and a big hit with everyone we have shared it with! Highly recommend! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays September 9, 2024 at 9:29 am Whoop! We’re so glad it’s been a hit. Thank you for sharing, Sophie! xo Coralsays September 3, 2024 at 6:42 am This recipe was delicious. Not hard to make and I was surprised that it tasted like a restaurant kebob. Couldn’t believed I cooked it. We made it in the grill and use metal sticks. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays September 3, 2024 at 9:33 am We’re honored that you found it to be restaurant-quality, Coral! Thank you for the lovely review! xo Janea D Bilalsays October 6, 2024 at 6:52 pm Wow. Sooo good. I added nutmeg & lemon juice and cooked stove top .Great recipe. Thank you Support @ Minimalist Bakersays October 7, 2024 at 9:08 am Those additions sound lovely! Thank you for sharing, Janea! Genevievesays August 15, 2024 at 10:51 am Made these last night, and they were easy and delicious. I did not bother with the skewers. I just formed them as directed in the recipe, then grilled them. Much easier IMO, but YMMV. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays August 15, 2024 at 3:11 pm We’re so glad you enjoyed them, Genevieve! Thank you for the lovely review and for sharing your simplified method! xo Melanie Asays July 14, 2024 at 8:58 pm Finally made this recipe and it did not disappoint! My husband even asked for seconds! We loved the spices and the all out flavor of these and will definitely keep them on rotation! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays July 15, 2024 at 10:27 am Whoop! We’re so glad you both enjoyed the recipe, Melanie. Thank you for sharing! xo Anneliessays July 2, 2024 at 1:13 pm I made these today with my 12-year old daughter – and no surprise when I say this is another successful recipe from you!We have a large family, so we made the recipe x 3.5, and ended up with 28 skewers… none left by the end of dinner, which speaks for itself.I had to make a couple of adjustments, and thought I’d share, in case they may be helpful for others. I didn’t have chicken mince, so put chicken breasts in the food processor until it looked like mince. It would have taken me a long time to grill 28 skewers, so I didn’t put the logs on sticks, I just put them in the air fryer for 10 minutes, and your handy advice of 74C interior temperature was spot on.The kebabs came out so well, really tasty (half parsley, half mint is a great idea you suggested), and for the fact they were all eaten is the biggest compliment to you :DWill definitely make these again. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays July 2, 2024 at 3:34 pm Amazing! We’re so glad the kebabs were a hit with the whole family. Thank you for the lovely review and for sharing your modifications, Annelies! xo Marysays June 30, 2024 at 11:51 am Any sub for coriander? And for bread crumbs, could I crush crackers (like saltines?)? Thanks! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays July 1, 2024 at 8:57 am Hi Mary, you could leave it out or sub more cumin. Saltines should work well, just reduce the amount of salt to compensate. Let us know how it goes! Marysays July 2, 2024 at 11:25 am turned out great! will definitely repeat this. so delicious Support @ Minimalist Bakersays July 2, 2024 at 12:00 pm Yay! We’re so glad you enjoyed it, Mary. Thank you for letting us know! xo Linesays July 25, 2024 at 7:51 am I made those yesterday and they were great.  Rather than breadcrumbs, I used rolled oats that I reduced to a coarse powder in the Magic bullet.  The taste and texture was amazing. Support @ Minimalist Bakersays July 25, 2024 at 8:07 am Lovely! Thank you for sharing, Line! xo Cindysays June 20, 2024 at 8:02 pm Wow wow. So easy, delicious, and fast! I made them into meatballs instead of skewers for ease and they turned out so flavorful! Will definitely make again! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays June 21, 2024 at 8:56 am Yay! Thanks so much for the lovely review, Cindy! Cjsays June 19, 2024 at 12:18 pm Absolutely delicious and quick to put together! We followed the recipe exactly but skipped the skewers and just rolled to form in our hands. We used ground chicken breast, and the almond flour substitute as we are gluten-free. We also cooked on a cast iron skillet as we don’t have access to a grill, they turned out perfect! We roasted a combination of veggies as a side; cauliflower, zucchini, peppers, and red onion, and served with hummus and lemon wedges. Definitely a new favorite in our household, already picked up ingredients to make again! Support @ Minimalist Bakersays June 19, 2024 at 1:46 pm YAY! We’re so glad you enjoyed the recipe and will be making it again, CJ. That sounds like a very delicious meal!
